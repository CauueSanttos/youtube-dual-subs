# Privacy Policy for YouTube Dual Subtitles

**Last Updated: April 5, 2024**

## Introduction

YouTube Dual Subtitles ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

### User Settings

- **Language Preferences**: We store your selected source and target languages for subtitle translation.
- **Display Preferences**: We store your preferences for how subtitles are displayed (enabled/disabled state).

### YouTube Data

- **Subtitle Content**: The extension temporarily processes subtitle content from videos you watch on YouTube in order to display dual language subtitles.
- **Video Metadata**: The extension may access basic information about the videos you're watching (such as video ID) to properly synchronize subtitles.

### Technical Information

- We do not collect any personal information, browsing history, or usage statistics.

## How We Use Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

1. **Providing Core Functionality**: To translate and display dual subtitles on YouTube videos
2. **Saving Your Preferences**: To remember your language and display settings

## Where Information is Stored

- **Local Storage**: Your preferences are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `storage.sync` API.
- **No External Servers**: We do not send your data to our own servers.
- **Google Translate API**: When translating subtitles, text is sent to Google's translation services. This is subject to Google's own privacy policy.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share or sell your data with third parties. The only data transmitted outside your browser is:

- Subtitle text sent to Google Translate API for translation purposes
